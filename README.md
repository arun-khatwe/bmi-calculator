A BMI Calculator is a C-based application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. This system will take user inputs for weight and height, perform the calculation, and categorize the BMI result into different weight status categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.
